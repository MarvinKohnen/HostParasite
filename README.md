# HostParasite

Agent Based Model for Host-Parasite Interactions using the Agents.jl package provided by Julia.

This is part of my Bachelorthesis regarding the Influence of the Cestode *Schistocephalus solidus* on the Copepod *Macrocyclops albidus*. 
Furthermore the model helps study Trophic Cascades regarding Copepods, Grazers, Parasites and Phytoplancton.

Supervised by Jaime Mauricio Anaya-Rojas @JaimeMAnayaRojas at the IEB MÃ¼nster.
